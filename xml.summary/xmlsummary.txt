XML Summary:
=========================

Why is XML important?
---------------------
XML supports information exchange between computer systems such as websites, databases, and third-party applications. 
Predefined rules make it easy to transmit data as XML files over any network 
because the recipient can use those rules to read the data accurately and efficiently.


=========================

Topics to cover:
---------------

- XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- XSL/XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)
- DTD (Document Type Definition) (Internal & External)
- XSD (XML Schema Definition) (Simple & Complex)
- XMLParser (DOM (Document Object Model), SAX (Simple API for XML))
- XQuery (XML Query)


=========================

Terminologies:
--------------

#1 standalone (yes/no) (XML declaration attribute on the document)
#2 XML Repeated (Multiple) element handling on DTD (with asterisk = *, i.e.: (#PCDATA)* )
#3 XML Schema Indicators:   
    Occurrence Indicators (maxOccurs, minOccurs)
    Group Indicators (Group name, attributeGroup name)
    Order Indicators (All, Choice, Sequence)
#4 If a document follows the rules it is said to be Valid:
    step:1)  Well formed   (Then only it is XML, otherwise it is Junk)
    step:2) Valid        (After having well-formed XML document, we work on validation) 
#5 Facets 
    Restrictions are used to define acceptable values for XML elements or attributes. 
    Restrictions on XML elements are called facets.
#6 XPath 
    (XPath uses "path like" syntax to identify and navigate nodes in an XML document)
    (XPath contains over 200 built-in functions)
    (XPath is a node/element navigator of the document followed by root element from DOM of the document)
#7 XQuery
    What is XQuery?
        - XQuery is the language for querying XML data
        - XQuery for XML is like SQL for databases
        - XQuery is built on XPath expressions
        - XQuery is supported by all major databases
        - XQuery is a W3C Recommendation

    XQuery can be used to:
        - Extract information to use in a Web Service
        - Generate summary reports
        - Transform XML data to XHTML
        - Search Web documents for relevant information
#8 XQuery and XPath
    XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same data model and support the same functions and operators. 
    If you have already studied XPath you will have no problems with understanding XQuery.
#9 IDE for XML is "XML Copy Editor"
    For easy testing on well-formatness and validation with one click,
    rather than using PHP for DTD and XSD validation check
#10 Online XML Tools
